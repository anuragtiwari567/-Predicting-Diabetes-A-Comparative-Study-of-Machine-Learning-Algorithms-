# Updated Diabetes Prediction Project

## Introduction
This project is an **enhanced version** of my previous diabetes prediction project. We'll continue to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals using machine learning algorithms. The goal remains the same: explore different models, evaluate their performance, and deploy the best one.

## Libraries Used
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: For numerical computations.
- `StandardScaler` from `sklearn.preprocessing`: To standardize feature scaling.
- `DecisionTreeClassifier` from `sklearn.tree`: For decision tree-based classification.
- `SVC` (Support Vector Classifier) from `sklearn.svm`: For support vector machine classification.
- `BernoulliNB` from `sklearn.naive_bayes`: For Bernoulli Naive Bayes classification.
- `train_test_split` from `sklearn.model_selection`: To split the dataset into training and testing subsets.
- `accuracy_score` and `confusion_matrix` from `sklearn.metrics`: For model evaluation.
- `matplotlib.pyplot` and `seaborn` for data visualization.

## Dataset
The dataset still contains the following features:
- `Pregnancies`: Number of pregnancies.
- `Glucose`: Blood glucose concentration.
- `BloodPressure`: Blood pressure.
- `SkinThickness`: Skinfold thickness.
- `Insulin`: Insulin level.
- `BMI`: Body mass index.
- `DiabetesPedigreeFunction`: A function that quantifies the genetic influence.
- `Age`: Age of the individual.
- `Outcome`: Binary outcome (0: No diabetes, 1: Diabetes).

## Workflow (Updated)
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values.
   - Standardize features using `StandardScaler`.
   - Split data into training and testing sets.

2. **Model Exploration**:
   - Explore different classifiers:
     - **Decision Tree Classifier**: Understand decision boundaries.
     - **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**: Investigate non-linear separations.
     - **Bernoulli Naive Bayes**: Assess probabilistic modeling.
   - Train each model on the training data.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Calculate accuracy scores.
   - Create confusion matrices.

4. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the best-performing model using Azure or another platform.

## Future Enhancements
Consider the following improvements:
- **Feature Engineering**: Explore additional features or transformations.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize model parameters.
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple models for better predictions.
- **Interpretability**: Understand model decisions using techniques like SHAP values.
